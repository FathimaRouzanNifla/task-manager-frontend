## Ensure API base URL is set (in .env or directly in code):


REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5001

## Start frontend app:

npm start
Open your browser to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.



## Postman Collection
The Postman collection containing all API endpoints is included in this repo under:

docs/TaskManager.postman_collection.json

Import it into Postman to test all endpoints with example requests.

## Deployment
